Apoorv Nag : Hello, formal. 
You : Yeah, hello. 
Apoorv Nag : Hello. Hi Komal. You are. You are signed in with Gmail or Rapid innovation ID. 
You : Gmail, this is the test Mala have created like for this selenium. Because with a rapid innovation, there's a tool like a their verification to their creating issues by logging. 
Apoorv Nag : Okay. Okay, that is fine. That is Okay, okay, that is fine. That is fine for testing you have created this, right?  
You : Yes, yes. 
Apoorv Nag : Yes, yes. Okay, fine. So fine. We will start with the quick updates so abhishek you can start. What are you up to? 
Abhishek Negi : Okay, fine. So fine. We will start with the quick updates so abhishek you can start. What are you up to? Yeah. They have to. Yeah, in day you told me to implement new architecture, right? 
Apoorv Nag : Can you explain the benefit and the features of that thing? 
Abhishek Negi : Can you explain the benefit and the features of that thing? Yeah, first to be done. Now our goal is first. We have to check if file is estate in our survival. File means. 
Apoorv Nag : Yeah, first to be done. Now our goal is first. We have to check if file is estate in our survival. File means. Platform. 
Abhishek Negi : Platform. video, then it's go in the S3 bucket.    First date and generate a piece and URL and every time it's generating place and do all then it's cost too much. Yeah, that's why we implement New Thing and whenever user click in any video, then that video saving our server the next time user. 
Apoorv Nag : Are you getting engaged common reshma? 
You : Oh, like a pre-shine has generated for the world like on the basis of request and then you are saving somewhere that Oh like a pre-shine has generated for the world like on the basis of request and then you are saving somewhere that you are in like, right? 
Abhishek Negi : Not URL. I am saving the file in the server. Yeah. 
You : So that will not take like any larger. If you are saving some videos in a server in Flower Server, so that will take a large memory 
Apoorv Nag : Right. 
Abhishek Negi : Yes. 
Apoorv Nag : What is the solution for that? 
You : That's even after some time like indicate the load is becoming higher. So server is getting slowly. 
Apoorv Nag : That's even after some time like indicate the load is becoming higher. So server is getting slowly. Right, right. So what is this? What can be the solution for that abhishek 
Abhishek Negi : M. We can increase the size of the server. 
You : So that is the so, that is the not or like 
Apoorv Nag :  
You : like an egg that I can say, horizontally vertically. We have, we know the database something, I don't know. The totally  horizontally is a good like Nicki. We have to create some duplication. Yeah. Maybe like a TV partition technically some information in that. I can database and some information. So maybe, like, for some time for like, any not for a long time, for this is also, we are, you can say, like a drawback. we cannot like the well, there's 
Apoorv Nag : Okay. 
You : Okay. ultimate like that temporary solution not a permanent. 
Apoorv Nag : ultimate like that temporary solution not a permanent. Okay. So Commerce Point is right, increasing the server size can help us to some extent, okay? It will work in our case in rapid innovation we can increase the size because our company strength is not that much. But yes at some point of time increase the increasing the server size 
You : Yes. 
Apoorv Nag : Yes. instances, Okay? Now, the next point comes, let's say traffic is handled, okay? If lots of traffic are coming, that it is under auto balance, it is under Auto Balancing Auto scaling and your that replica is getting created. Now, What will happen if database is getting chilled, let's say if there are 10 instances at a time, which is 
You : okay, must 
Apoorv Nag : okay, must The main DB is known as master DB which which lets you to write the data on that DB. Okay, but all the read queries will be done with the slave disease, okay?  
You : Yes. 
Apoorv Nag : balancer, you can scale up, you can do the horizontal scaling for instance and using master slave architecture. You can do the horizontal scaling for your databases. Okay, but there comes in another point of fun. The funny part here is let's say you are reading 
You : He? 
Apoorv Nag : He? But the balance has not updated because the read query has been triggered on the slave TV. So this type of lag is known as master slave. Replication. Lag. Okay, so if you are scaling, your database using horizontal scaling by using master slave architecture, then we will end up with master slave. Replication lag. To fix this. we have an idea, but 
Apoorv Nag : Yes, it's We will be having one master TB, multiple slave DBS. All the right queries will be executed on main dB and that data is replicated in all the slaves. But if we quickly 
Abhishek Negi : like, Thank you. 
Apoorv Nag : data, it will take some time. 
You : Yes, yes. 
Pravin Prabhakar Mohadika : This. 
Apoorv Nag : of feature using our EC2 instance. Cdn means. Whenever you host your image in any of the server. You cannot access that image server from around the world. Because if you are sitting in us and you're accessing that image from Mumbai, let's say your images stored in Mumbai server, then image of 10, MB will take 30 seconds to 
Apoorv Nag : Okay. network. Which works like caches there are lots of content delivery network around the world. They just see if the request is not serviceable, Let's say you're asked for a image link if that is missing in the Syrian, it will hit the Mumbai server, it will get that. It would, it will get it in 30 seconds. 
Abhishek Negi : He? 
Apoorv Nag : Let's say on every month, we are uploading 10. GB of videos. At some point of time, the 20 GB limit, can get exceeded. If we are taking a hard disk of 20 GB, In our server. So what we will do, we will remove the older videos, the videos which are not getting access anymore. We will delete them from EC2 instance. Is it okay? Common. 
You : In our server. So what we will do, we will remove the older videos, the videos which are not getting access anymore. We will delete them from EC2 instance. Is it okay? Common. Yeah, yeah. Getting getting something. We have there's a lot of 
Apoorv Nag : Okay, so this is what we are up to, in video portal. What are you up to in Google? Meet extraction of. Plus. 
You : Okay, so this is what we are up to, in video portal. What are you up to in Google? Meet extraction of. Plus. yeah, like See there's every time I'm going to think so, I'm going to analyze the different different things. So I'm just like I want a more two days to. I can say 
Apoorv Nag : Okay, you need only two more days. 
You : Yeah, because key I made it something like on my copy. Like, I'm just trying to do something. 
Apoorv Nag : Okay. 
You : This. 
Apoorv Nag : What about you provide? What are you doing? 
Pravin Prabhakar Mohadika : What about you provide? What are you doing? Oh yeah, he just like Mike Cook. Pottery refactoring is a, he's like completed just a commenting part is very meaning enough. After that, I will check with the like, Means that that transmit products. 
Apoorv Nag : Okay, I want to understand one thing if your food and Comals could are same. Then I 
Pravin Prabhakar Mohadika : Same here. 
Apoorv Nag : creating that text file and writing the output on the final transcript file are same, right. 
Pravin Prabhakar Mohadika : Yes. 
Apoorv Nag : Only the middle. Main logic is different. 
Pravin Prabhakar Mohadika : Yes. 
Apoorv Nag : Yes. Also I will also try to think and implement some logic if possible. 
You : And there is one more website I can show you like you can get the free formatter. So you just like Nicki whatever And there is one more website I can show you like you can get the free formatter. So you just like Nicki whatever. We are taking the captions, like, with 
Apoorv Nag : can we can analyze easily. Take it. Yeah. Yeah, we can analyze. I don't want to. I don't want that to analyze. I want to write my own 
You : Okay. Okay. And yeah, yeah. So you 
Apoorv Nag : Parallel to yours, parallel to yours. Chicken. Yeah, I can look I can do that. Yeah.  Great, great. So, coming back to 
Reshma sadhu waghmare : Oh, maybe. 
Apoorv Nag : Okay. Take care. So, reshma is basically creating a to-do list. So what I am going to do from I will see if we can let her scale up on blockchain technology or not but it all depends as of now since on on 18th, August reshma will be completing one month with us. So I hope till 18 others. She's fine with this API part. Once she is done, then we will scale up on Blockchain as well. Okay. Toyota Expert. Yes. 
Pravin Prabhakar Mohadika : Oh yes. 
Apoorv Nag : Okay. See, basically, Pilant by using Thailand, we can check out some formatting error some You have to update, you have to daily update the Tickets, like, you have a daily update. The tickets with the commitment commits, which you are doing those commits should have the proper names. Ticket name the ticket number, then your commit message. Okay, Do you have any questions or you want to? You want me to repeat? No. 
Abhishek Negi : So, it's clear. 
Apoorv Nag : It's good. Okay, okay. See you guys then anything else you want there? It's good. Okay, okay. See you guys then anything else you want that? You want to discuss guys? 
Abhishek Negi : Yeah, I have a question. Yeah, just have my video are safe. At least. URL. Plus it's less static slash video and file name Dot mp4, right? I'll get my vote for more videos. 
Apoorv Nag : Right. 
Abhishek Negi : So it's Metaphase security bridge over here. 
You : It's a public list organization. 
Apoorv Nag : There was your S3 volume. Dictionary. Public Health Logic. 
Abhishek Negi : like, You come on a main goal yet. I keep a private. 
Apoorv Nag : like, You come on a main goal yet. I keep a private. Uh-huh. Cheeky birthday. 
You : Uh-huh. Cheeky birthday. You don't go authentication, job look. JWT tokens, use CORUSIBILITY login.   
Abhishek Negi : Many. 
Apoorv Nag : that problem will be solved but concept and your future roadmap me. Okay. 
Pravin Prabhakar Mohadika : Yep. 
You : Bye. 
Pravin Prabhakar Mohadika : Bye. Woman. And this can trans transcripts here. 
You : Woman. And this can trans transcripts here. hmm play, why don't I  Just Thailand. He died. Thailand, but you 
Pravin Prabhakar Mohadika : Attention could. Attention could be here. 
You : Attention could be here. Might Thailand, but you attention could be here my time, but your dish. 
Pravin Prabhakar Mohadika : You friend different part of our channel. 
You : You friend different part of our channel. How much differences are here? Cannot say like you ebony characters. Your character caption both doing sentences coffee mismatch. Is Matt wrongly later. 
Pravin Prabhakar Mohadika : You cannot tell you. But but Google meet such a caption is Kind a zoom. Zoom Zumba caption on both the channel please. 
You : Maybe like they have used some different concepts zunga book options, the poverty about taking your voice, power to be, whatever would say pro perfectly. Capturing them, don't get translated. Hey, work around here. 
Pravin Prabhakar Mohadika : Remember you? 
You : Eat a manager. Be committed piano. Here, where function Cooper woman? Could you 
Pravin Prabhakar Mohadika : He? He when 
You : oh, you say 
Pravin Prabhakar Mohadika : he comments.
