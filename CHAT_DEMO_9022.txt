Vijay Mishra : a very certain spam awards. We are no missing certain like words, 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. So, commonly have you 

You : People have shared? 

Apoorv Nag : file? 

Apoorv Nag : ? okay, okay. 

You : Yeah, yeah, 

You : shared you. 

Apoorv Nag : Four, five, 

Apoorv Nag : , three, four. 

Apoorv Nag : . yeah. 

Apoorv Nag : . so, 

Apoorv Nag : , this is the part, which we have 

Apoorv Nag :  captured 

Apoorv Nag :  in this text. 

Vijay Mishra : You can put it parallely 

Vijay Mishra : , like no, split, two windows. like i mean, this 

Vijay Mishra :  txt. oh, and 

Vijay Mishra :  extension one, because we are doing it 

Vijay Mishra :  that way. no, like that only and, 

Apoorv Nag : Right. Right. 

Vijay Mishra :  

Vijay Mishra :  all, this did not transcript. now. 

Vijay Mishra :  put it into google's, 

Vijay Mishra : . okay and just take the api  

Vijay Mishra :  configuration. now all the 

Vijay Mishra :  api okay, and just take the api configuration.  

Vijay Mishra : . now all the authentication other thing 

Vijay Mishra :  

Vijay Mishra :  and put it in google seat.  for the compatibility purpose because extension is also putting it into google's, it only 

Vijay Mishra :  dog. 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : So, you Google Dog, because that 

Vijay Mishra :  will be really good for you to compare it. 

You : Okay. 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

You : Sure, sure. 

You : . and then, next time, i'll let it in. 

Apoorv Nag : such a common, I want 

Apoorv Nag :  to. 

Apoorv Nag : . como, can you tell me 

Apoorv Nag :  one thing? can't you run the script 

Apoorv Nag :  parity to this while screen sharing open any other browser. 

Apoorv Nag : Then we can just verify here now. 

You : Apurro. Make your 

You :  voice is breaking.  

Apoorv Nag : I'm saying it. Can't you share the screen? 

Apoorv Nag :  parallely by recording 

Apoorv Nag :  while recording that content? 

You : yeah, I'll share like I don't know like 

You : , i don't know, like this just now 

You :  before just i tested it was working skin. i'm able to share 

You :  my screen but i the 

You :  like i have a 

You :  remove, the things like 

You :  something, so maybe the system setting is 

You :  do not 

You :  allowing to share my screen. so, 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. One thing which we can do 

You : Can I 

You :  do like, 

Apoorv Nag : which have which 

Apoorv Nag : do like  

Apoorv Nag : , once i sorted short to 

Apoorv Nag :  this matter with komal, then i will 

Apoorv Nag :  ping you. okay?  

Vijay Mishra : And noise was a perfectly fine. 

Apoorv Nag : chicken, 

Vijay Mishra : I think 

Apoorv Nag : , it just give 

Vijay Mishra :  the thing is, i just told you could just to 

Vijay Mishra : ld you could just to the best thing would be, you know, just 

Vijay Mishra :  compare these two things and the same dog 

Vijay Mishra :  in a same like so 

Vijay Mishra :  extension is doing in a google doc, 

Vijay Mishra : . so we should also like no dump in the google doc 

Vijay Mishra : . so we should also like no dump in the google doc and then we can compare it 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : And that will be 

Vijay Mishra :  good. 

You : Yes, will that money 

You :  that can possibility after 

You :  like meeting god index? 

Apoorv Nag : Um, 

You : Both file and we can start 

Vijay Mishra : how obviously I think 

Vijay Mishra :  you have 

You : comparison. 

Vijay Mishra : Have you please do that? And 

Vijay Mishra :  once you're done like, no, just you can you guys 

Vijay Mishra :  can save it. 

Vijay Mishra : . and okay, i put one thing, you know, 

Vijay Mishra : , like no 

Vijay Mishra : , just you can you guys can save it. and okay, i put one thing, you know, like no since we are, we will be working for next like, you know, few weeks, 

Vijay Mishra :  i think for  

Vijay Mishra :  apa like development. so 

Vijay Mishra :  i'll be creating like, no, i'll be 

Vijay Mishra :  creating like, no, i'll be assigning. you a pool. 

Vijay Mishra : . like no in the, in the same zero board that we're doing it. 

Vijay Mishra :  and the rapid trans you can 

Vijay Mishra :  you guys can save it. and okay, i put one thing, you know, like no since we are, we will be working for next like, you know, few weeks i think for apa like development. so i'll be creating like, no, i'll be assigning. you a pool. like no in the in the same zero board that we're doing it and the rapid trans you can find it on the zira,  

Vijay Mishra : . there's something called epic runs in the rapid trans only. i'll be, 

Vijay Mishra :  creating like, no, i'll be assigning. you a pool. like no in the in the same zero board that we're doing it and the rapid trans you can find it on the zira. there's something called epic runs in the rapid trans only. i'll be i'll be, you know, creating like walk 

Vijay Mishra :  or maybe eps work 

Vijay Mishra :  for you guys and you guys can use the same zero 

Apoorv Nag : He absolutely absolutely. 

Vijay Mishra : Will that be okay? 

Apoorv Nag : Absolutely, I was about to talk about this. 

Vijay Mishra : Hmm. 

Apoorv Nag : These 

Apoorv Nag :  tickets are in your dashboard where you 

Apoorv Nag :  are mentioned. 

Vijay Mishra : Yes, exactly. That. 

Vijay Mishra : . what you guys need to do with? that is 

Vijay Mishra :  entire product, you know zera  

Vijay Mishra :  that we trans. so this 

Vijay Mishra :  application we are calling it as of now is a rapid 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : Okay. 

Apoorv Nag : And till now the ticket which we have 

Apoorv Nag :  created for common praveen. it is in 

Apoorv Nag :  our python team dashboard can be transferred, 

Apoorv Nag :  or should i leave it there only 

Vijay Mishra : I think anyway, you know, I'm not 

Vijay Mishra :  joking if you are going to like 

Vijay Mishra : , if 

Vijay Mishra :  we are really going to proceed with it because i think for next 

Vijay Mishra :  couple of weeks, you guys need to work 

Vijay Mishra :  on the epa, you know, because 

Vijay Mishra :  look, that thing is already like 

Vijay Mishra :  no completed, but since there's 

Vijay Mishra :  few problems with it and which is 

Vijay Mishra :  like very minor one so  

Vijay Mishra :  we can like, you know, do that later. 

Apoorv Nag : Ticket. 

Vijay Mishra : Or or you guys can finish 

Vijay Mishra :  it. like that won't be an issue. 

Apoorv Nag : Ticket. 

Vijay Mishra : Because anyway, like 

Vijay Mishra :  you guys need to fix it very friend, 

Apoorv Nag : Right. 

Vijay Mishra : later that you 

Vijay Mishra :  guys need to finish it. 

Apoorv Nag :  

Apoorv Nag :  more like in this project. 

Apoorv Nag : , the current 

Apoorv Nag :  apas for fireflies 

Apoorv Nag :  are in graphql and we can create it 

Apoorv Nag :  in rest api. will it be okay? 

Vijay Mishra : A perfectly. Finally, 

Vijay Mishra : . we did it no in the for the last project that we have 

Vijay Mishra :  done in the variant, the this 

Apoorv Nag : ? 

Vijay Mishra :  project called variant 

Vijay Mishra :  for the haskite client and and we did it in the 

Vijay Mishra :  for the last project that we have done in the variant the this project called variant for the haskite client and and we did it in the flask api. we have created what you have, 

Vijay Mishra : , you know, we have created fast 

Vijay Mishra :  apis. okay. 

Vijay Mishra : , for, for back and, and front end. so they 

Vijay Mishra :  they took over api and they used it. 

Vijay Mishra : . so, have you guys tested over 

Vijay Mishra :  like website. i think few 

Vijay Mishra :  times back, i just shared with it here with 

Vijay Mishra :  the group. you know, 

Vijay Mishra : , that afghan thing. 

Apoorv Nag : No. 

Vijay Mishra : Okay, so that  

Vijay Mishra : project is actually deployed.  

Vijay Mishra :  and we deployed it, you know, 

Vijay Mishra : , on these basis or something. so 

Vijay Mishra :  we do have a creative liberty to use 

Vijay Mishra :  that thing. same thing anyway, 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : So, we'll be doing 

Apoorv Nag : Take. 

Vijay Mishra : The point here is, you know, we have used like 

Vijay Mishra :  no earlier this fast epa. 

Vijay Mishra : . so i would suggest 

Vijay Mishra :  you to use like no django or like no. some other thing which 

Vijay Mishra :  is mean no more robust. 

Vijay Mishra : . you guys know in a better position 

Vijay Mishra :  to suggested which api which 

Vijay Mishra :  no framework we should use. 

Vijay Mishra : . you know, so 

Apoorv Nag : Take take it. 

Vijay Mishra : , just to 

Vijay Mishra :  give you a prospective, let me 

Vijay Mishra :  share with you what we have done. 

Vijay Mishra : . so, like 

Vijay Mishra : , you know, 

Vijay Mishra : , the number of different features that we're creating 

Vijay Mishra :  for every single feature. we need 

Vijay Mishra :  to like no creator aps. 

Vijay Mishra : . okay, so let me give you  

Vijay Mishra :  a prospective, let me share with you what we have done. so like, you know, the number of different features that we're creating for every single feature, we need to like no creator aps. okay, so let me give you a, let you know little framework that what we have 

Vijay Mishra :  done. so like, you know, the number of different features that we're creating for every single feature, we need to like no creator aps. okay, so let me give you a, let you know little framework that what we have done in the past. 

Vijay Mishra : . okay, and for the 

Vijay Mishra :  variant 

Vijay Mishra :  group that i'm saying, 

Vijay Mishra : , see. 

Vijay Mishra : , is it visible? 

Vijay Mishra : ? 

Apoorv Nag : Yeah. 

Vijay Mishra : Hmm. 

Vijay Mishra : . so basically there 

Vijay Mishra :  was like no front end called he has variant, 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : okay? And 

Vijay Mishra :  we have basically created these apis, like 

Vijay Mishra :  no uploading images api apis, like no uploading images api and 

Vijay Mishra :  we have basically created these apis, like no uploading images api, and like, no result api another. no different features 

Vijay Mishra :  api, and and all these things 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : class, 

Vijay Mishra : , only okay, 

Vijay Mishra : , similarly, like now we will be having 

Vijay Mishra :  like no front end 

Vijay Mishra :  and although like no backend stuff. okay. so 

Vijay Mishra :  someone needs to like no  

Vijay Mishra : w we will be having like no front end and although like no backend stuff, okay? so someone needs to like, no build initially this. 

Vijay Mishra : , this apis. okay, around the features that we have. 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : Okay. And 

Vijay Mishra :  once this done then we can like no discuss about 

Vijay Mishra :  the building the entire back and another other stuff. 

Vijay Mishra :  you're getting it. so 

Vijay Mishra :  this project was deployed this is the entire 

Vijay Mishra :  back and another other stuff you're getting it. so this project was deployed this is the entire like no framework that what we have done till now. 

Vijay Mishra : . so this is the main thing that i 

Vijay Mishra :  just want you guys to know like 

Vijay Mishra :  see so, these 

Vijay Mishra :  apis we might need to create  

Vijay Mishra :  similar. not this one. 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : okay, 

Vijay Mishra : , making sense like we would 

Apoorv Nag : Yes. Yes. 

Apoorv Nag : . what about you komal and praveen.  

Apoorv Nag : . are you getting? are you guys getting 

Apoorv Nag :  this? 

Pravin Prabhakar Mohadika : Yes. 

Vijay Mishra : just don't let get 

Vijay Mishra :  into all this no stuff. these one 

You : They could not much care, 

Vijay Mishra : complicated. 

You : getting 

Vijay Mishra : Hard. Just just see these things. Like, you know, the Apis. 

Vijay Mishra :  this thing.  

Vijay Mishra : . so we need to create it so we can like know 

Vijay Mishra :  later on. we can be able to like 

Vijay Mishra :  no integrate with the front and back another things. 

Vijay Mishra : . so these things will i think 

Vijay Mishra :  have you guys like no worked in products on? 

Vijay Mishra :  for like 

Apoorv Nag : Yeah. 

Vijay Mishra :  python android or anything. 

Apoorv Nag : . the yes i can deploy 

Apoorv Nag :  these application on docker containers 

Vijay Mishra : Okay. 

Apoorv Nag : Yeah. 

Apoorv Nag : . and komal, and praveen has worked 

Apoorv Nag :  with s3. also. so they know how to upload 

Apoorv Nag :  using. please send url 

Vijay Mishra : So have you guys like no work done? Like 

Vijay Mishra :  eight of us ec2 machines 

Apoorv Nag : yes, I have worked but formal 

Vijay Mishra : On cloud. 

Apoorv Nag : Praveen are new. 

Vijay Mishra : So, 

Vijay Mishra : , look at you guys need to like, know, i think 

Vijay Mishra :  do like to do more 

Vijay Mishra :  study on that on all those things. i think. 

Vijay Mishra :  do like to do more study on that on all those things. i think that what we need to do 

Vijay Mishra :  more study on that on all those things. i think that what we need to do, i think in the latest stage 

Vijay Mishra :  was the rapid trans is 

Vijay Mishra :  at click. no, at least two certain level. 

Vijay Mishra : . i mean, most probably after this 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : so, 

Vijay Mishra :  these things need to understand like anyway, 

Vijay Mishra : , just leave this thing 

Vijay Mishra :  for now. so, let me 

Vijay Mishra :  for example, like no. 

Vijay Mishra : . see 

Vijay Mishra :  like, for example, like no, see this week, this 

Vijay Mishra :  one matrix, we are showing it 

Vijay Mishra :  okay, let me 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : , so for example,  

Vijay Mishra : , like now we are in this matrix. yes, you know, 

Vijay Mishra : , so casing of this single 

Vijay Mishra :  participant in the meeting and 

Vijay Mishra :  they're participation, okay? 

Vijay Mishra : , so for example, like now we are in this matrix. yes, you know, so casing of this single participant in the meeting and they're participation. okay? so for example, take this as 

Vijay Mishra :  a as a matrix and you know, we need to create 

Vijay Mishra :  a api for this thing. so, 

Vijay Mishra :  whenever, you know, this api 

Vijay Mishra :  was like no asked from the front 

Vijay Mishra :  end ui and then we need 

Vijay Mishra :  to create a api for this thing. so whenever, you know, this api was like no asked from the front end ui and then we need like no using this api that you will 

Vijay Mishra :  be creating we need to like no pass 

Vijay Mishra :  the information related. 

Vijay Mishra : be happen. 

You : but, 

Apoorv Nag : Okay, currently. 

Apoorv Nag : . where is the result data stored? 

Vijay Mishra : Currently. It's like 

Vijay Mishra :  it's a simple like no data frame. like we just 

Vijay Mishra :  a simple data frame right now. 

Vijay Mishra : . like no, the one transcript that we are, 

Vijay Mishra : , you know, extracting out of meeting. 

Apoorv Nag : Haha. 

Vijay Mishra : , all 

Vijay Mishra :  these things. are we able to do? 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : you know, although the sentiment part 

Vijay Mishra :  of it like, for example, the entire 

Vijay Mishra :  sentiment, the 

Vijay Mishra :  entire meeting, okay. 

Vijay Mishra : . um, for 

Vijay Mishra :  for make you to understand, 

Vijay Mishra : , let me like so if today's only 

Vijay Mishra :  

Vijay Mishra :  for example, let's see this thing like no today we had a  

Vijay Mishra :  meeting with person present you 

Vijay Mishra :  okay, so 

Vijay Mishra :  see this thing. this thing was directly generated by 

Vijay Mishra :  like now our ml model 

Apoorv Nag : Hmm. 

Vijay Mishra : entire 

Vijay Mishra :  summary. so this meeting went for 30 to 

Vijay Mishra :  45 minutes, okay? 

Vijay Mishra : ? and this is the entire summary of 

Vijay Mishra :  it, you're getting it 

Vijay Mishra : , the entire summary was, 

Vijay Mishra : , you know, done by the ml. and see this is like do 

Vijay Mishra :  this. not like 

Vijay Mishra :  i i we haven't rotated the machine loaded, okay? 

Apoorv Nag : oh, 

Vijay Mishra : So you can see it like, no. So for example, 

Vijay Mishra : , for this thing, you need to 

Vijay Mishra :  create a api, you're getting it. 

Vijay Mishra : , so you will be feeded by our data. for 

Vijay Mishra :  example, take this example, 

Vijay Mishra : , like, no, the transcript. we do have 

Vijay Mishra :  a transcript from any meeting. okay. 

Vijay Mishra : , once we have 

Vijay Mishra :  a meeting meeting transcript, then we'll be using our, 

Vijay Mishra : , you know, like our bart model 

Vijay Mishra :  or any other model for that. 

Vijay Mishra :  sake. and using those 

Vijay Mishra :  model will be like, you know, transforming that script into 

Vijay Mishra :  a summary. okay. so 

Vijay Mishra :  for this summary, we need to create a api somebody 

Vijay Mishra :  api, okay, getting it. so 

Vijay Mishra :  this summary api  

Vijay Mishra :  needs to create it 

Vijay Mishra :  for this thing, makes sense.  

Apoorv Nag : Yeah. 

Vijay Mishra : and accordingly, we might need to create 

Vijay Mishra :  tool like more functionality for other things, 

Vijay Mishra : . for example, see this thing like 

Vijay Mishra : , no someone 

Vijay Mishra :  may need to like know fetch. what 

Vijay Mishra :  exactly happened in the meeting. for example, if you want to see 

Vijay Mishra :  what's at i what sort of dates 

Vijay Mishra :  or what sort of timelines that we 

Vijay Mishra :  have discussed 

Vijay Mishra :  in the meeting, for example, you know, i said key, 

Vijay Mishra : , you know, a poor, i need 

Vijay Mishra : , no this api to be done 

Vijay Mishra :  by 31st of 

Vijay Mishra :  no like  

Vijay Mishra :  august. so see this like no this thing 

Vijay Mishra :  like no someone may need to like know fetch. what exactly happened in the meeting. for example, if you want to see what's at i, what sort of dates or what, sort of timelines that we have discussed in the meeting. for example, you know, i said key, you know a poor, i need no this api to be done by 31st of no like august. so see this like no this thing needs to 

Vijay Mishra :  extract, you're getting it. so we'll be using all the 

Vijay Mishra :  ml and other other algorithms to know 

Vijay Mishra : , start all those things. so 

Vijay Mishra :  these things are also working. and you can see like, 

Vijay Mishra : , you know, so this is the participation ratio 

Vijay Mishra :  that we have extracted 

Vijay Mishra :  out of today's meeting only. so 

Vijay Mishra :  today is like no presently. the worst 

Vijay Mishra :  participation was around 49%. 

Vijay Mishra :  is i 

Vijay Mishra : s the participation ratio that we have extracted out of today's meeting only. so today is like no presently. the worst participation was around 49% is i, mine was like, 33% and then obviously, 

Vijay Mishra : , if my teammate and kiran was this thing 

Vijay Mishra : , you're getting it. so, similarly, we 

Apoorv Nag : Well, yes. 

Vijay Mishra : for 

Vijay Mishra :  indivisible participant in the meeting. 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : so, 

Vijay Mishra :  this will be one api. okay, 

Vijay Mishra : ? similarly like this will be 

Vijay Mishra :  one api, okay? similarly, like, this will be one api  

Vijay Mishra : . okay? similarly, like, this will be one api. the like the sentiment for entire meeting, that 

Vijay Mishra :  was the participation. this one is the 

Vijay Mishra :  participation, 

Vijay Mishra : . this one is the participation. okay. the like who are the speakers? 

Vijay Mishra : ? who speak? most? okay, 

Vijay Mishra : , and was engaging 

Vijay Mishra : . and this one is the party, the sentiment 

Vijay Mishra :  for entire meeting that was the participation. this one is the participation. okay. the like who are the speakers? who speak? most? okay, and was engaging. and this one is the party, the sentiment basically. so, 

Vijay Mishra : , the entire sentiment like, 

Vijay Mishra :  you click 

Vijay Mishra :  combining all the people who spoke 

Vijay Mishra :  okay. 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : Like no 

Vijay Mishra :  spoke like mostly so  

Vijay Mishra :  90 86% neutral. 

Vijay Mishra : . and 5% negative and like 

Vijay Mishra :  no fight, it wasn't positive. so all 

Vijay Mishra :  this like no sentiment is like, no extracted you getting it. 

Apoorv Nag : Yes. 

Vijay Mishra : so, 

Vijay Mishra :  around this, we need to create apis for the 

Vijay Mishra :  complete meeting plans. no sentiment 

Vijay Mishra :  analysis, we need to create one api for this. 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : Again, we need to create 

Vijay Mishra :  in a one api where all the user 

Vijay Mishra :  all the 

Vijay Mishra :  user, all the participant in the meeting. so we can fetch sentiment related to all the 

Vijay Mishra :  user, all the participant in the meeting so we can fetch a sentiment related to all the participants 

Apoorv Nag : , 

Vijay Mishra : so, 

Apoorv Nag : , i i 

Vijay Mishra : , these 

Vijay Mishra :  hmm. 

Apoorv Nag : directly stored 

Apoorv Nag :  in the database or 

Apoorv Nag :   are we finding it a real name? 

Vijay Mishra : No, not not in the 

Vijay Mishra :  real time, we will be 

Vijay Mishra :  diagnosed to we will be putting into somewhere in the  

Vijay Mishra :  real time we will be diagnosed to we will be putting into somewhere in the db somewhere. you're not 

Vijay Mishra :  plan anything thought of right now 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : walking on this 

Vijay Mishra :  thing only 

Apoorv Nag : but, 

Apoorv Nag : , so, we 

Vijay Mishra : so, 

Apoorv Nag :  will be, we will be getting 

Apoorv Nag : database structure so that we can 

Apoorv Nag :  create those get apis around them. 

Apoorv Nag : . or do we have to create that 

Apoorv Nag :  database design also? 

Apoorv Nag : ? i mean to say, 

Apoorv Nag : , database design is ready or do we have to figure it out? 

Vijay Mishra : no, we had to figure it out that we also need 

Vijay Mishra :  to do like 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : I think 

Vijay Mishra :  a pool like we need to like no state and think about 

Vijay Mishra :  keywords will be the appropriate thing to do 

Vijay Mishra :  it like no, for example, where we 

Vijay Mishra :  saw the story. like, for example, what let me tell you like, you know, 

Vijay Mishra : , right now we're doing it simple 

Vijay Mishra : . like we are taking the data from 

Vijay Mishra :  like google, you know, google talk 

Vijay Mishra :  as i said, okay? from google talk. 

Vijay Mishra :  as i said, okay? from google talk, using api, like that 

Vijay Mishra :  directly getting it. and then we are, you know, using those 

Vijay Mishra :  transcript 

Vijay Mishra :  into all these insights 

Vijay Mishra :  summary and all these 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra :  insights summary and all these stats. 

Vijay Mishra : So, these things. Are we doing it? 

Apoorv Nag : Hmm. 

Vijay Mishra : Okay, so 

Vijay Mishra :  so, that's it. like i think guys of now, so we will be walking on different 

Vijay Mishra :  finding different matrixes and 

Vijay Mishra :  once we found and once we found the 

Vijay Mishra :  matrix is, we'll be asking you guys to know create apis for that. 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : Hmm. 

Apoorv Nag : The game. 

Apoorv Nag : . so according to you like, currently in our mind, 

Apoorv Nag : , it is it like first of 

Apoorv Nag :  the meeting will happen? 

Apoorv Nag : ? the transcript will be stored in google drive, then 

Apoorv Nag :  we will store the  

Apoorv Nag :  reports to and we will 

Apoorv Nag :  store the reports to and we will do 

Apoorv Nag :  all the processing and feed the data on the 

Apoorv Nag :  third step. 

Vijay Mishra : this is, 

Vijay Mishra :  this is 

Apoorv Nag : . 

Vijay Mishra :  this is right now and this is just for the some know, some demonstration purposes, a very preliminary 

Apoorv Nag : . 

Vijay Mishra :  things, but we are not going to do that. no. 

Vijay Mishra : . like you said we need to create a no 

Vijay Mishra :  robust thing and as a back end where 

Vijay Mishra :  we are going to create another db, 

Vijay Mishra : , proper db where these things these things 

Vijay Mishra :  will be stored and we will be pulling you know, 

Vijay Mishra : , data from that db and then doing all the 

Vijay Mishra :  analysis and then 

Vijay Mishra :  doing all the analysis and then using your api will be like no connect, no 

Vijay Mishra :  building the bridge to 

Vijay Mishra : , you know, past the data. 

Vijay Mishra : . 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. I 

Apoorv Nag :  have i got the idea. 

Vijay Mishra : Again. 

Vijay Mishra : . to like, 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Apoorv Nag : . when you want to connect 

You : One more 

Apoorv Nag :  next. 

You :  question like from my 

Vijay Mishra : Happy please. Yes. 

Vijay Mishra : He? 

Apoorv Nag : Oh 

You : participants you calculating 

You :  based on the like a conversation. yeah 

You : . based on the timing. 

You : . like the 

Vijay Mishra : Yes, the conversation. 

You : are joined. 

You : Based on the conversation, 

Vijay Mishra : This one is 

You : , right? 

Vijay Mishra :  directly, this is this,  

Vijay Mishra :  that you based on the conversation and this is just 

Vijay Mishra :  a very, very little matrix. 

Vijay Mishra :  a kind of already demo thing 

Vijay Mishra :  and these are very 

Vijay Mishra :  basic metrics. we are 

Vijay Mishra :  talk of way different matrixes this 

Vijay Mishra :  just for the demo thing. 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

You : Okay. 

Apoorv Nag : Praveen. Do you have any good out or you want to ask 

Apoorv Nag :  anything? 

Pravin Prabhakar Mohadika : I know not not now. 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Apoorv Nag : . he can. okay, 

Apoorv Nag : , we got an idea. 

Apoorv Nag : . we will 

Apoorv Nag :  let us so. 

Apoorv Nag : . so the first step will be, we will figure 

Apoorv Nag :  out the database design. 

Apoorv Nag : , we will discuss with 

Apoorv Nag :  you, okay? we will 

Apoorv Nag :  let us so. so the first step will be, we will figure out the database design, we will discuss with you, okay? we will discuss every process like, 

Apoorv Nag :  for all ins and out 

Apoorv Nag :  of the system. okay. 

Vijay Mishra : Hmm. 

Apoorv Nag : , then 

Vijay Mishra : . not being here. 

Apoorv Nag : yeah, so I was 

Apoorv Nag :  telling you 

Apoorv Nag :  we will figure out the ins and out of the system. how the data 

Apoorv Nag :  is flowing from which place to which place 

Apoorv Nag :  to which place and 

Apoorv Nag :  the database design and the set of 

Apoorv Nag :  apis, which are required. 

Vijay Mishra : Hmm. 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. So, these three things 

Apoorv Nag : , the data flow, the er 

Apoorv Nag :  diagram, i mean the 

Apoorv Nag :  tables, which i needed, and the 

Apoorv Nag :  apis. right. 

Vijay Mishra : Yes. 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : Sure. One 

Vijay Mishra : , actually, i started working on some sigma 

Vijay Mishra :  design for it, 

Vijay Mishra : , it's not completed 

Vijay Mishra :  though. let me so you guys like 

Vijay Mishra :  so 

Vijay Mishra :  i think i put, we need like no build 

Vijay Mishra :  this thing and i'm 

Vijay Mishra :  i'm like, i'm just on you. like, let's see. 

Vijay Mishra :  how 

Vijay Mishra :  we should like no build it. 

Vijay Mishra : . is. 

Vijay Mishra : . okay. 

Vijay Mishra : . do you guys 

Vijay Mishra :  like so i think about, we need like no build this thing and i'm i'm like i'm just on you. like let's see how we should like no build it. is. okay. do you guys are looking on 

Vijay Mishra :  the poor? 

Apoorv Nag : Yes. 

Vijay Mishra : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : . and 

Apoorv Nag : That we have our 

Apoorv Nag :  own organization rapid python. there we are managing 

Apoorv Nag :  our code. 

Vijay Mishra : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : . so like 

Vijay Mishra :  see this thing for now. i think will 

Vijay Mishra :  created later. so, i think the 

Vijay Mishra :  idea is very simple, 

Vijay Mishra : . i think komal and you guys can also look 

Vijay Mishra :  into it. so they initial idea was 

Vijay Mishra :  to, you know, create a bot. i think 

Vijay Mishra :  will created later. so i think the idea is very simple. i think komal and you guys can also look into it. so they initial idea was to, you know, create a bot, i think. so the bot will be this thing. 

Vijay Mishra :  for now. i think will created later. so i think the idea is very simple. i think komal and you guys can also look into it. so they initial idea was to, you know, create a bot, i think. so the bot will be this thing. yeah, dot ml at the rate rapid, innovation 

Vijay Mishra :  dot them. okay, so this one will be 

Vijay Mishra :  this thing. yeah, dot ml at the rate, rapid, innovation, dot them. okay, so this one will be our bot, okay. so this 

Vijay Mishra :  one will be our bot, okay? so this board, you know, will be 

Vijay Mishra :  this thing. yeah, dot ml at the rate, rapid innovation dot them. okay, so this one will be our bot, okay? so this board, you know, will be invited by all the 

Vijay Mishra :  like managers or maybe those who 

Vijay Mishra :  are creating the meeting, okay? 

Vijay Mishra : , so this one will be our bot, okay? so this board, you know, will be invited by all the like managers or maybe those who are creating the meeting. okay, so once they're going to invite this, 

Vijay Mishra : , what? so 

Vijay Mishra :  that's this bot will be extracting all the, 

Vijay Mishra :  like managers or maybe those who are creating the meeting. okay, so once they're going to invite this, what? so that's this bot will be extracting all the you know meetings which is assigned 

Vijay Mishra :  to this 

Vijay Mishra :  calendar. yeah. okay, once that, 

Vijay Mishra : , you know, assigned, then this board 

Vijay Mishra : , you know, will be invited by all the like managers or maybe those who are creating the meeting. okay, so once they're going to invite this, what? so that's this bot will be extracting all the, you know, meetings which is assigned to this calendar. yeah. okay, once that, you know assigned, then this board is going to extract no 

Vijay Mishra : . using a one script, we will be extracting all 

Vijay Mishra :  the you know, meetings which is assigned to this calendar. yeah. okay, once that, you know assigned, then this board is going to extract no. using a one script, we will be extracting all those calendar events. 

Vijay Mishra : . you guys can. no, don't like these things. 

Vijay Mishra : . we need to do it. okay, so calendar script.  

Vijay Mishra : , we need to do it. so once we can 

Vijay Mishra :  know like fetch all the 

Vijay Mishra :  you know, meetings which is assigned to this calendar. yeah. okay once that, you know assigned then this board is going to extract no. using a one script. we will be extracting all those calendar events you guys can. no, don't like these things. we need to do it. okay, so calendar script, we need to do it. so once we can know, like fetch all the data, all the calendar events, okay? i think. 

Vijay Mishra :  we have done 

Vijay Mishra :  some work on it based on like 

Vijay Mishra :  for example, there are five different meetings. 

Vijay Mishra : . okay that that what needs to  

Vijay Mishra :  connect so using like no 

Vijay Mishra :  ground or some other stuff that we need to like know 

Vijay Mishra :  make this bot. 

Vijay Mishra :  join that meeting based on the time 

Vijay Mishra :  the the latest time. okay? 

Apoorv Nag : Okay, 

Apoorv Nag : , okay. 

Vijay Mishra : So so you guys 

Vijay Mishra :  understood now like you know, we need to create a, 

Vijay Mishra : , you know, so  

Vijay Mishra :  there will be calendar. so this board will be extracting using 

Vijay Mishra :  no python script or something. all the 

Vijay Mishra :  calendar events. once the calendar 

Vijay Mishra :  events. once the calendar event is extracted. then 

Vijay Mishra :  based on the 

Vijay Mishra :  timing, it's going to 

Vijay Mishra :  like, you know, join the meat. okay, once the meeting is joined.  

Vijay Mishra :  no. see, there's a extraction calendar event. so neat, we need to do this thing. and then, you know, the selenium skip will run 

Vijay Mishra :  once this in trigger 

Vijay Mishra :  the calendar time and event. okay? 

Vijay Mishra : ? so these things then it needs to 

Vijay Mishra :  perform. and then after that, now these 

Vijay Mishra :  things our script will do 

Vijay Mishra :  like you know performing talks like no doing all 

Vijay Mishra :  the like you guys are inputting. the 

Vijay Mishra : re's a extraction calendar event. so need we need to do this thing and then, you know, the selenium skip will run once this in trigger the calendar time and event. okay? so these things then it needs to perform. and then after that, now these things our script will do like you know, performing talks like no doing all the like you guys are inputting. credential meeting credential mike mike 

Vijay Mishra :  and camera like turn off. 

Vijay Mishra :  join the meat, turn off to turn on 

Vijay Mishra :  caption and all 

Apoorv Nag : When I 

Vijay Mishra : These 

Apoorv Nag :  write, 

Vijay Mishra : you guys are already working it and  

Apoorv Nag : hmm. 

Vijay Mishra : this thing. So 

Vijay Mishra :  this is 

Vijay Mishra :  working for now like as of now 

Vijay Mishra : . and then we are not putting it 

Vijay Mishra :  into a dbapur right  

Vijay Mishra :  now. so we 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : no, no 

Vijay Mishra : you want,  

Vijay Mishra :  like energy jason 

Vijay Mishra :  so we are putting into json as well 

Vijay Mishra :  and to csv as well. and 

Vijay Mishra :  to csv as well, and like we need like women this 

Vijay Mishra :  right now. we need 

Vijay Mishra :  like this right now. we need in csv for performance 

Vijay Mishra :  purposes and other things like for testing, another 

Vijay Mishra :  research purposes and 

Vijay Mishra :  other things like for testing, another research purposes and like the jason. so we are doing it 

Vijay Mishra :  later. we can think about you where we need to do 

Vijay Mishra :  and in what format we need to like now put in 

Vijay Mishra :  dv so this part is not done 

Vijay Mishra :  till now that's why it's great. 

Apoorv Nag : oh, 

Vijay Mishra : So 

Vijay Mishra :  this is what we need to do and  

Vijay Mishra :  this yellow one right now. we are working on 

Vijay Mishra :  this thing. 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : Okay. So you guys needs to, you know, take 

Vijay Mishra :  care of this this part. 

Vijay Mishra : . okay, so 

Apoorv Nag : This part. Can you just 

Apoorv Nag :  highlight over it like from 

Apoorv Nag :  which steps you are talking? 

Vijay Mishra : I think these things, you know, these things are 

Vijay Mishra :  we are not going to do in the beta beta version 

Vijay Mishra :  these now record, because we 

Vijay Mishra :  will be giving the functionality to record the 

Vijay Mishra :  meat, okay? and once you record the meat, 

Apoorv Nag : Hmm. 

Vijay Mishra : we'll store the video 

Vijay Mishra :  into our database, okay? and 

Vijay Mishra :  in the at a latest stage, once the beta 

Vijay Mishra :  is released for the public then 

Vijay Mishra :  no using the 

Vijay Mishra :  esr like no speech definition on other stuff. 

Vijay Mishra : , we will be using you know, someone 

Vijay Mishra :  mls stuff to 

Vijay Mishra :  extract transcript or some other 

Vijay Mishra :  insights out of the video 

Vijay Mishra :  into our database, okay? and in the at a latest stage once the beta is released for the public, then no, using the esr like no speech definition on other stuff, we will be using, you know, someone mls stuff to extract transcript or some other insights out of the video that is being recorded and 

Vijay Mishra :  posting the db and then we'll perform all those 

Vijay Mishra :  tasks. so that is the different thing 

Vijay Mishra :  don't get into it. this 

Vijay Mishra :  is not ever work as of now. that's why it's in gray, 

Vijay Mishra : . so currently, we need like no builder 

Vijay Mishra :  db so you will be 

Vijay Mishra :  using, you know, someone mls stuff to extract transcript or some other insights out of the video that is being recorded and posting the db and then we'll perform all those tasks. so that is the different thing don't get into it. this is not ever work as of now. that's why it's in gray. so currently we need like no builder db so you will be doing all this thing. i mean 

Vijay Mishra :  no, what will be there? 

Vijay Mishra : , what will extract? all the meeting 

Vijay Mishra :  and then skip 

Vijay Mishra :  will run based on the event and 

Vijay Mishra :  then these tasks will perform 

Vijay Mishra :  once this task performed and 

Vijay Mishra :  same script will put 

Vijay Mishra :  the entire caption in the db 

Vijay Mishra : . once the db 

Vijay Mishra : . once the db once you pushed into db then we 

Vijay Mishra :  will take care extraction. 

Vijay Mishra : . sorry 

Vijay Mishra :  this caption and the transcript from db and then 

Vijay Mishra :  skip will run based on the event and then these tasks will perform once this task performed and same script will put the entire caption in the db. once the db once you pushed into db then we will take care extraction. sorry this caption and the transcript from db and then we'll do the further processing, 

Apoorv Nag : Oh, okay. 

Vijay Mishra : Now 

Vijay Mishra :  approve, when approve you and me, we need 

Vijay Mishra :  like no build the other 

Vijay Mishra :  architecture behind it. now, the db 

Vijay Mishra :  the other api is known like you're getting 

Vijay Mishra :  things from db 

Vijay Mishra :  and then you are giving one api 

Vijay Mishra :  for data like for transcript, api, 

Vijay Mishra :  is known like you're getting things from db and then you are giving one api for data like for transcript api. and then using that api, we 

Vijay Mishra :  will be getting the data. okay, in whatever 

Apoorv Nag : Right. 

Vijay Mishra :  format that we want, okay, 

Vijay Mishra : Okay, once we get that data, 

Vijay Mishra : , then we'll do the ml ml  

Vijay Mishra :  ml compute on top of that data 

Vijay Mishra : , then we'll do the ml ml ml compute on top of that data.  and once that done then 

Vijay Mishra :  using other 

Vijay Mishra :  you those results. 

Vijay Mishra :  and then those apis 

Vijay Mishra :  will be you know used by the front and other 

Vijay Mishra :  guys. 

Apoorv Nag : Yeah. 

Vijay Mishra : bombarded with information? 

Apoorv Nag : I am completely understanding. 

Apoorv Nag :  every inch 

Apoorv Nag :  of it and it 

Apoorv Nag :  looks cool. and i think 

Apoorv Nag :  this yellow portion which we have shown 

Apoorv Nag : , these are these will be also  

Apoorv Nag :  some kind of apis, which will be using 

Apoorv Nag :  and storing the aggregated 

Apoorv Nag :  reports here. so we don't have to 

Apoorv Nag :  find the reports every time 

Apoorv Nag :  calculate 

Vijay Mishra : Ah, 

Vijay Mishra : , this was done like no way back and i think couple of 

Apoorv Nag :  

Vijay Mishra :  four weeks back i would say but 

Vijay Mishra :  now since like today, 

Vijay Mishra :  like a person said key you know we  

Vijay Mishra :  guys you guys need to walk along 

Vijay Mishra :  with no python team for and 

Vijay Mishra :  ask them to develop the abs. so 

Vijay Mishra : n said key you know we guys you guys need to walk along with no python team for and ask them to develop the abs so you guys need to like no creator 

Apoorv Nag : That's okay. 

Vijay Mishra : APIs and other stuff and 

Vijay Mishra :  so that's it. i think that maybe 

Apoorv Nag : Yeah. 

Vijay Mishra : We need like no walk on the 

Vijay Mishra :  ml compute part, another insights thing 

Vijay Mishra :  and the python thing i think 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra :  

Vijay Mishra :  a poor when you and me like we need to like 

Vijay Mishra :  know build the apis and like more 

Apoorv Nag : Take. 

Vijay Mishra : architecture behind this. 

Apoorv Nag : Sure. 

Vijay Mishra :  is 

Vijay Mishra :  created way back. 

Apoorv Nag : Okay, we will go through. What are the things 

Apoorv Nag : ? which are already done, which one of  

Vijay Mishra : Hmm. 

Apoorv Nag :  that thing i want to 

Apoorv Nag : it here for example in the initial 

Apoorv Nag :  that set up. well, the google body 

Apoorv Nag :  joining the meeting 

Apoorv Nag :  these part like running the surname script 

Apoorv Nag :  inside the cloud. easy to instance is 

Apoorv Nag :  it done or we have 

Apoorv Nag :  to do. 

Vijay Mishra : no, 

Vijay Mishra : , that that will do it. like i think that is 

Apoorv Nag : . 

Vijay Mishra :  not me. we haven't run it like more 

Vijay Mishra :  in the ec2 but i think we, 

Apoorv Nag : Actually. 

Vijay Mishra : very private 

Vijay Mishra :  private experience of what doing all those things. so 

Vijay Mishra :  that is not a big task force, okay. 

Apoorv Nag : Ticket. 

Vijay Mishra : That hardly take, you know, like, 

Vijay Mishra :  much more time, like, 

Apoorv Nag : I think running selenium using 

Apoorv Nag :  in desktop, it is easy for 

Vijay Mishra : Yeah. 

Apoorv Nag : running it in a 

Apoorv Nag :  cli. i don't 

Apoorv Nag :  know how much support does. it get selenium in.  

Vijay Mishra : except that thing that 

Apoorv Nag : Scale. 

Vijay Mishra :  even, i'm 

Apoorv Nag : Together. 

Vijay Mishra : Won't be nice 

Vijay Mishra : for first. Like we have a private experience 

Vijay Mishra :  on this but that 

Vijay Mishra :  keeps aside that thing. but think about one thing you 

Apoorv Nag : Hmm. 

Vijay Mishra : a meeting simultaneously, 

Vijay Mishra : , you know, 100 meeting is going on 

Vijay Mishra : getting it and 100 meeting, you know, 

Apoorv Nag : Right. 

Vijay Mishra : for for doing ML compute, that takes time. 

Vijay Mishra : . no, the somebody that i just saw you now. 

Vijay Mishra :  it, somebody itself takes 

Apoorv Nag : Mmm. 

Vijay Mishra : four minutes to 

Vijay Mishra :  a process, you're getting it. 

Vijay Mishra : . given the given the local system that 

Vijay Mishra :  i am having, and 

Apoorv Nag : All right. 

Vijay Mishra : four minutes. So 

Vijay Mishra :  you can imagine like no we need to like 

Vijay Mishra :  no use various different tools  

Vijay Mishra :  like selenium, other selenium 

Apoorv Nag : yes, 

Vijay Mishra : other stuff. 

Apoorv Nag : those 

Apoorv Nag :  ml script in queues and not 

Apoorv Nag : directly. 

Vijay Mishra : We  

Vijay Mishra :   

Vijay Mishra :  rabbit and use salary workers and 

Vijay Mishra :  these other stuff we need to do. 

Apoorv Nag : Hmm. Okay. 

Vijay Mishra :  

Vijay Mishra :  so, 

Vijay Mishra :  that part will come later, but 

Vijay Mishra :  that part so that part will come later but currently we need to design the apis like percentage. 

Apoorv Nag : Chicken. 

Apoorv Nag : . take it. okay. 

Apoorv Nag : , i will, i will 

Apoorv Nag :  i will write a database schema and 

Apoorv Nag :  i will show it to you and we 

Apoorv Nag :  will discuss. thinking. 

Vijay Mishra : Ha. 

Vijay Mishra : . so, i think 

Vijay Mishra :  so, let me know  

Vijay Mishra :  you you do that thing and let me,  

Vijay Mishra :  know you, you do that thing and let me, you know, design this thing like database thing 

Vijay Mishra :  and what are sort of api that we 

Vijay Mishra :  need to create. and then i'll also to you 

Vijay Mishra :  then we can like no sit and like 

Vijay Mishra :  no. see what's so different thing that we can do around 

Vijay Mishra :  around it. 

Apoorv Nag : Sure, sure. 

Apoorv Nag : . okay. 

Apoorv Nag : , so we 

Apoorv Nag :  will connect tomorrow. or they. 

Vijay Mishra : New high. 

Apoorv Nag : connect. 

Vijay Mishra : How tomorrow tomorrow how we need  

Vijay Mishra :  like doing tomorrow. i think. 

Apoorv Nag : TK. 

Vijay Mishra : I'll have 

Vijay Mishra :  you can pin me anytime. 

Apoorv Nag : And chicken. 

Apoorv Nag :  and comer and praveen will be fixing the 

Vijay Mishra : Hmm. 

Apoorv Nag : Or 

Apoorv Nag : assign them some other 

Apoorv Nag :  task? also, in this project, 

Vijay Mishra : ah, I think we might 

Apoorv Nag : like creating 

Vijay Mishra : think you know look 

Vijay Mishra :  for being and komal. i think you need 

Vijay Mishra :  like no put more work or more hard 

Vijay Mishra :  work. i think to understand the  

Vijay Mishra :  building the logic because you guys are missing 

Vijay Mishra :  data. i think 

Vijay Mishra :  you need like no, put more work or more hard work. i think to understand the building the logic because you guys are missing data. i think and then it's already been like you some, 

Vijay Mishra :  of you said, it will take like three days. 

Vijay Mishra : . so, i think it's like, 

Vijay Mishra : , not 

Vijay Mishra :  like no saying any time parameter but it's like second week 

Vijay Mishra :  so i think like put more 

Vijay Mishra :  work or more hard work. i think to understand the building the logic because you guys are missing data. i think and then it's already been like you some of you said, it will take like three days. so i think it's like, not like no saying any time parameter, but it's like second week so i think like, put more high. i think focus and 

Vijay Mishra :  more hard work. i think they know to create logic behind it 

Vijay Mishra : 's already been like you some of you said, it will take like three days. so i think it's like, not like no saying any time parameter, but it's like second week. so i think like, put more high, i think focus and more hard work. i think they know to create logic behind. it would the logic would be 

Vijay Mishra :  appropriate. 

Vijay Mishra : . we better not likely lose any data as 

Vijay Mishra :  comparatively with extension. 

Vijay Mishra : . 

Apoorv Nag : Mmm. Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : Is making sense like komal and praveen 

Vijay Mishra : Is making sense like common for you guys. 

Vijay Mishra : . is it like making sense for you guys? 

Vijay Mishra : . is it like making sense for you guys? hello. 

You : Yes. Actually, 

Pravin Prabhakar Mohadika : Yes. 

You : , as for now 

Vijay Mishra : Hmm. 

You : No. 

You : . yeah, visa as per 

You :  now like any whatever 

You :  i we had made it the logic in that i 

You :  like not losing 

You :  any data but like 

You :  one. yes. two like maybe in whole 

You :  like it hundred line, we have a hundred like  

You :  maybe in one line 

You :  maybe in two line. there is a duplication only 

You :  data is 

You :  not losing right now. 

You : . it's only that like a one percent, 

You : . i can say two percent, i can set  

You :  up the application is happening.  

You : due to like the 

Vijay Mishra : data, 

You :  converse, 

Vijay Mishra : , now that data 

Vijay Mishra :  the data anyway, you are 

You : yeah. 

Vijay Mishra : Even we, you know, like 

Vijay Mishra :  achieved accuracy over there. so i can tell 

Vijay Mishra :  you even like we 

Vijay Mishra :  saw that problem. so data obviously we're 

You : Yes. 

Vijay Mishra : it. No way while printing it. The 

Vijay Mishra :  problem is, while you are pending that data into 

Vijay Mishra : somewhere you're getting it. Then 

Vijay Mishra :  that's a problem. you need to create a 

Vijay Mishra :  logic behind it. i told 

Vijay Mishra :  you like, you know, you don't need to like, no go through the previous works. like, 

Vijay Mishra : , you know, you don't need to like no go through the previous works like like joining the meeting and other 

Vijay Mishra :  credential sort of stuff you need to. 

Vijay Mishra :  create a logic behind it. i told you like, you know, you don't need to like no go through the previous works like like joining the meeting and other credential sort of stuff. you need to create a logic, really 

Vijay Mishra :  robust logic. around 

Vijay Mishra :  caption extraction. that is important 

Vijay Mishra :  part. the 

Vijay Mishra :  thing that you're telling me that i entirely understood your, we are not missing data. obviously 

Vijay Mishra :  we are the data is getting upended like multiple 

Vijay Mishra :  times and it's getting duplicated. 

Vijay Mishra : . that is the concern. 

Vijay Mishra : . if that, now what you're saying. 

You : Yeah, 

You : , that i like 

You :  yes. what we 

You :  had like  

Vijay Mishra : . 

You :  nikki as a like a caption where we had. i had a captured 

You :  all things like i shared the that 

You :  filed it to a poor. also  

You :  in that we can like go through that, okay? anything 

You :  is happening duplication is  

You :  happening because i try to 

You :  like again, i will make the 

Vijay Mishra : Look. 

You :  like 

Vijay Mishra : . look, 

You : better logic 

Vijay Mishra : Do do one. Do one thing. 

Vijay Mishra : . do one thing. health care with you. you know what 

Vijay Mishra :  we have done it so and you can compare it with the  

Vijay Mishra :  extension and you can see no 

Vijay Mishra :  who we are. you won't be able to find even a one. 

Vijay Mishra :  word which is missing or which is 

Vijay Mishra :  missing or which is getting duplicated. okay, so 

Vijay Mishra :  if you want to, 

Vijay Mishra :  i'll mostly i'll share with you, if 

Vijay Mishra :  you want to i'll mostly i'll share with you if i found one. 

Vijay Mishra : . so you guys can see it. like so you need like 

Vijay Mishra : , no, create a logic. i think 

Vijay Mishra :  very, very minor is 

Vijay Mishra :  that we're missing. not like, you know, doing getting duplicated. 

Vijay Mishra : . okay, so if you want to i'll mostly i'll share with you if i found one. so you guys can see it. like so you need like, no create a logic. i think very, very minor is that we're missing. not like, you know, doing getting duplicated. so those things we already 

Vijay Mishra :  like accomplished, you 

Vijay Mishra :  getting it? so just 

You : Yes. 

Vijay Mishra : the 

Vijay Mishra :  logic that is important and whatever 

Vijay Mishra :  that you're saying and completely getting it because 

Vijay Mishra :  i have faced the same issue. 

Vijay Mishra : . getting it our team. feel the same 

Vijay Mishra :  issue. getting it our team. feel the same, is that whatever that you're discussing. 

Vijay Mishra : . any confusion like you can 

Vijay Mishra :  talk about it. 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Apoorv Nag : . now vijay, can we add you in our 

You : Well no, no confused. 

Apoorv Nag : Can we add you in our 

Apoorv Nag :  slack group, where we are communicating regarding the 

Apoorv Nag :  project or do you have your own project group? 

Apoorv Nag : ? in slack. 

Vijay Mishra : Obviously, like I do have 

Vijay Mishra :  my group like but anyway, you can like 

Vijay Mishra :  invite if you want 

Apoorv Nag : Athletic. 

Vijay Mishra : but we 

Vijay Mishra :  do have a like, a ml group. 

Apoorv Nag : And then you 

Apoorv Nag :  will invite you in our group. you can take 

Apoorv Nag :  follow-ups from there also. 

Vijay Mishra : To about to be very 

Vijay Mishra :  friendly. hi, i'm just stuck in 

Vijay Mishra :  my, you know, in our walk usually. 

Vijay Mishra : . so, but obviously like, i think, i think 

Vijay Mishra : , i think it all these people 

Vijay Mishra :  are doing really great. no, no, like, dog with that. but i'm thinking 

Vijay Mishra : , i think no  

Vijay Mishra : w, in our walk usually. so, but obviously, like, i think, i think it all these people are doing really great. no, no, like, dog with that. but i'm thinking, i think. no comparatively. we need like, 

Vijay Mishra :  no work hard on that. i mean, think really hard  

Vijay Mishra :  because, like, we always also like not 

Vijay Mishra :  tried the same thing. 

Vijay Mishra :  but like, we were facing issues 

Vijay Mishra :  but we somehow managed to, 

Vijay Mishra : , you know, build the logic. 

Vijay Mishra : . but again, the logic is no having some 

Vijay Mishra :  limitation very, very minor limitation 

Vijay Mishra :  but we 

Vijay Mishra :  somehow managed to, you know, build the logic. but again the logic is no having some limitation very, very minor limitation but we we need to like no more on some other stuff. so we 

Vijay Mishra :  like we are achieve the 

Vijay Mishra :  one one level i think and 

Vijay Mishra :  that level is i think it's it's good. 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. 

Vijay Mishra : Even like no, 

Vijay Mishra : , we suggested like the percentages 

Vijay Mishra :  are, you know, there's still some limitation he was 

Vijay Mishra :  pretty convinced that this is working perfectly fine. 

Apoorv Nag : Action. 

Vijay Mishra :  

Vijay Mishra :  we suggested in key, you know, there are certain like a 

Vijay Mishra :  limitation while using this. 

Apoorv Nag : Okay. Okay, we 

Apoorv Nag :  will try to deep dive in 

Apoorv Nag :  the logic and meanwhile, 

Vijay Mishra : How 

Vijay Mishra :  i think. 

Apoorv Nag : and we will try to fix it because the main 

Apoorv Nag :  logic when we try to rethink. 

Apoorv Nag : . now again we have to 

Apoorv Nag :  write the logic from the scratch.
