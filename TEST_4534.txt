Vijay Mishra : abu no, i had a word with no prasan today so i think no, we need to do one thing

Vijay Mishra :  we need like no start building apis. okay.

Vijay Mishra :  for the thing that we have,

Vijay Mishra :  you know, created because we,

Apoorv Nag : oh,

Vijay Mishra : we work

Vijay Mishra : four weeks now. So I think we reached to a point

Vijay Mishra : where person no wants

Vijay Mishra : you guys

Vijay Mishra : to know create apis before 31st of

Vijay Mishra : august. you know, after that.

Vijay Mishra :  so after that, once

Vijay Mishra : that done after that, no will be inviting

You : the second just

Vijay Mishra : front and

Vijay Mishra : backend guys to properly, you know, create

Vijay Mishra : ui like you seen one with

Vijay Mishra : five files.ie. okay.

Vijay Mishra :  the same thing, we need to do

Vijay Mishra : a similar sort of product. we are building it but

Vijay Mishra : no initially for a couple of months

Vijay Mishra :  we are trying to

Vijay Mishra : know at the functionality

Vijay Mishra : in rapid view itself. okay,

Vijay Mishra :  whatever they're doing it. so once

Vijay Mishra : the internal, our

Vijay Mishra : internal organization is doing, you know, using that thing

Vijay Mishra : that we trans. so once that no,

Vijay Mishra :  they convince an all other things, all the testing

Vijay Mishra : box are fixed. then we are going to launch it.

Vijay Mishra :  now, as individual

Vijay Mishra : product in the market for the public,

Apoorv Nag : Okay.

Vijay Mishra : okay, so I think

Vijay Mishra : you guys need to

Vijay Mishra : create or no apis and i'll talk about in the detail.

Vijay Mishra :  i'll be i'll be no

Vijay Mishra : demonstrating you. what we have achieved

Vijay Mishra : now, okay? so for those

Vijay Mishra : functionality, we

Vijay Mishra : need to create apis.

Vijay Mishra :  okay. so we can, you know,

Vijay Mishra :  so once that apis is

Vijay Mishra : completed, then we can give it to no backend

Vijay Mishra : for for them to know

Vijay Mishra : like

Vijay Mishra : build build, you know, play

Vijay Mishra : what i would say bridge or something you know

Vijay Mishra :  so once that apis is completed, then we can give it to no backend for for them to know like build build. you know, play what i would say bridge or something you know from the front and back and to integrate

Vijay Mishra : all those things. so i'll be explaining

Vijay Mishra : noises with that but you want to know

Vijay Mishra : what concept like what we are

Apoorv Nag : Yes.

Vijay Mishra : planning.

Apoorv Nag :  yes basically we are going to

Vijay Mishra : 

Apoorv Nag : store this transcript in the similar way

Apoorv Nag : as fireflies do and we have to expose

Vijay Mishra : 

Apoorv Nag : that data.

Apoorv Nag :  through our apis.

Vijay Mishra : Exactly. So no front and can

Vijay Mishra : call our api, you know. and

Vijay Mishra : can call our api, you know, and they can

Vijay Mishra : so on their ui or maybe you know,

Vijay Mishra :  and they can so on their ui or maybe you know you maybe back and people can

Vijay Mishra : take that and you know put it

Vijay Mishra : somewhere maybe. i don't know what these people are doing it in the

Vijay Mishra : back end, so i'm not

Vijay Mishra : sure like no, whether we can like build

Vijay Mishra : entire pie, entire like no backend and

Vijay Mishra : python itself is like what you think like

Vijay Mishra : no, whether we can like build entire pie, entire like no backend and python itself is like what you think? like, you must be aware about it. so,

Vijay Mishra : what do you think? like is it?

Vijay Mishra :  like possible. i'm obviously it's

Vijay Mishra : possible but what your take on it?

Vijay Mishra : self is like what you think? like, you must be aware about it. so what do you think? like is it? like possible. i'm obviously it's possible, but what your take on it? so do we build our like backend

Vijay Mishra : this particular products back in python itself?

Apoorv Nag : Yeah, absolutely.

Vijay Mishra : Or.

Apoorv Nag : I am very positive

Vijay Mishra : Okay.

Apoorv Nag : Like we can build the

Apoorv Nag : transcript, module in

Apoorv Nag : python. okay.

Apoorv Nag :  and this product will be integrated with your

Apoorv Nag : main product, which is having that

Apoorv Nag : chatbot and all right,

Apoorv Nag :  so, i wanted to know, like which type of

Apoorv Nag : authorization you have done in that platform, is

Apoorv Nag : it google or

Vijay Mishra : No, no

Vijay Mishra : slightly. actually, you know, you are,

Vijay Mishra : merging two things. a chatbot is not part of this

Vijay Mishra : thing. this is the entire different product.

Vijay Mishra :  this is a rapid chance. they're calling it rapid

Apoorv Nag : Okay.

Vijay Mishra : And chatbot is

Vijay Mishra : entirely a different thing that is different project.

Apoorv Nag : Okay.

Vijay Mishra :  so this is entirely.

Vijay Mishra : I'll teach you.

Vijay Mishra :  i'll show you guys what we have done till now and

Vijay Mishra : what's other different api that we might

Vijay Mishra : need and i would suggest

Vijay Mishra : no approve that

Vijay Mishra : this will give really good capabilities to us like key

Vijay Mishra : if we can build no entire fight and

Vijay Mishra : backend that

Vijay Mishra : we really perfect. i would say

Vijay Mishra : me, I think we should do

Apoorv Nag : And

Vijay Mishra : like

Apoorv Nag : yeah.

Apoorv Nag :  i am totally

Apoorv Nag : fine with the idea and

Apoorv Nag : i understand

Apoorv Nag : the basic entities which they,

Apoorv Nag :  which fireflies is storing in their backend,

Vijay Mishra : Hmm.

Apoorv Nag : And

Apoorv Nag : features like roles,

Apoorv Nag : which they are using as

Apoorv Nag : because they are managing fireflies,

Apoorv Nag :  user base separately than the

Apoorv Nag : users, who are joining the meeting.

Apoorv Nag :  okay.

Vijay Mishra : hi, you, you know,

Vijay Mishra :  you'll surprise to know that. no,

Apoorv Nag : 

Vijay Mishra :  we achieved some of the things on the matrix is

Apoorv Nag : 

Vijay Mishra : that is way better than no fire files,

Vijay Mishra : too. like no summary and

Vijay Mishra : other sentiment sort of things

Vijay Mishra :  another matrix is like no participation of a

Vijay Mishra : user in a meeting, all those other things.

Vijay Mishra :  so we already achieved it. so

Vijay Mishra : all those things will be, you know, will be

Vijay Mishra : you know, will be there in the application that we will

Vijay Mishra : be noveloping.

Vijay Mishra :  so, like whatever work

Apoorv Nag : Okay.

Vijay Mishra : till now based on that,

Vijay Mishra :  you know we might need to create eps

Vijay Mishra : for that. i'll be i'll be showing

Vijay Mishra : that maybe today or maybe some

Vijay Mishra : other day. so,

Vijay Mishra :  common, i

Vijay Mishra : think you can throw it if it's working.

Apoorv Nag : A common present, the screen.

Apoorv Nag :  or are you having any

Apoorv Nag : problem, while presenting

Apoorv Nag : the screen? komal you are on mute.
